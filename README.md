# sql-challenge
Module 9 Challenge

My challenge files are saved in EmployeeSQL as follows:
    -QuickDBS-SQL_Challenge.png
        - The diagram created in QuickDBD shows the relationships between the CVS files and the the data.
        - After completing and running the SQL queries, I realized I had two typos.  One was in the file name dept_emp, I spelled it dep_emp.  The other was in the title dept_no.  I spelled it dep_no.  By the time I discovered the errors, I was out of time for completing the project on time. Thus there are two errors which caused two of my data analysis Query List of questions to fail. 
    -QuickDBD-SQL-Challenge.sql completed correctly
    -Table_Schema.sql worked correctly.
    Query.sql as stated above had 2 of the query list fail.  I believe they would have completed correctly, if not for the typo.

    The project was a difficult one for me.  I struggled with the logic of Primary and Foreign keys, and ended up asking my classmate Bobbi Fletchall for help.

    For references, rewatched class video recordings, researched on ChatGPT, and as stated above asked classmate for help.
